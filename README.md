Project Title:- Contact-Us Form with Validation and POST API Integration

Project Overview:-
The Contact Form with Validation and POST API Integration is a web application developed using React and Material-UI. It allows users to fill out a contact form, validates the form inputs, and sends the form data to a specified API endpoint via a POST request.

The project demonstrates the following features:

i)A responsive and user-friendly form interface created using Material-UI components.
ii)Form validation using the react-hook-form library to ensure that required fields are filled and inputs match specific patterns (e.g., email, phone number, zip code).
iii)Integration with a POST API endpoint to send the form data for further processing or storage.

Technologies Used
i)React: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
ii)Material-UI: A popular React UI framework for creating visually appealing and responsive components.
iii)react-hook-form: A library for form validation and management in React.
iv)Fetch API: A built-in web API for making HTTP requests to the API endpoint.
v)JavaScript: The programming language used for the application logic.
vi)HTML: The markup language used for structuring the web page.
vii)CSS: The styling language used for customizing the appearance of the components.

Installation and Setup
i)Clone the project repository from GitHub: <repository_url>
ii)Navigate to the project directory: cd contactus-form
iii)Install the dependencies: npm install
iv)Start the development server: npm start
v)Access the application in a web browser at http://localhost:3000

Usage
i)Fill in the contact form fields, including name, email, phone number, zip code, and message.
ii)The form validates the inputs in real-time and displays error messages if any of the fields are not filled or have invalid formats.
iii)Once all fields are valid, click the "Submit" button to send the form data to the specified API endpoint.
iv)The application makes a POST request to the API endpoint with the form data in JSON format.
v)If the request is successful (HTTP status code 200-299), a success message is logged in the browser console, and the form is reset.
vi)If an error occurs during the submission, an error message is logged in the browser console.
